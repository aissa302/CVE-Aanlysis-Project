JSPs used as error pages must must ensure that they handle any error dispatch as a GET request, regardless of the actual method.

The files can be written to any location accessible by Flink 1.5.1. All users should upgrade to Flink 1.11.3 or 1.12.0 if their Flink instance(s) are exposed. The issue was fixed in commit a5264a6f41524afe8ceadf1d8ddc8c80f323ebc4 from apache/flink:master.',\n",

This vulnerability affects you only if you are using the `code` or `password-reset` auth method with the `auth.methods` option or if you have enabled the `debug` option in production. By using two or more IP addresses and multiple login attempts, valid user accounts will lock, but invalid accounts will not, leading to account enumeration. This issue has been patched in versions 3.5.8.2, 3.6.6.2, 3.7.5.1, and 3.8.1. If you cannot update immediately, you can work around the issue by setting the `auth.methods` option to `password`, which disables the code-based login and password reset forms.',\n",
